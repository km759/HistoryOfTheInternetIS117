                Jeff Bezos, Amazon founder and Pierre Omidyar, the founder of eBay, where the pioneers of ecommerce in the early internet era. While Jeff Bezos and Pierre Omidyar had similar ideas on taking advantage of the web, they both took different paths. Since Jeff Bezos worked in Wallstreet as a data entry accountant, he decided to use the web to sell books online since it would be impossible for a building to hold that many books and people know where everything is, thus, Amazon was created and it was a massive hit. Jeff Bezos had to redo his growth plan since they were growing at a much faster pace than they initially thought. On the other hand, Pierre Omidyar, a programmer who had no experience related to business saw an opportunity as well and decided to create an auction online market known as eBay. He created eBay over a long vacation weekend with just 3 main components that included: Create an item/list an item, get a list of all the items that have been created and bid on the desired item. These two individuals were able to grow their business in no time, giving that the internet was still on its early stages of being in the public, but how? When the radio was invented it took 38 years before 50 million people were using it, when the TV was invented it took 13 years to reach 50 million people, and once the internet opened up to the general public it took only 4 years before it had 50 million users. Thanks to these two laws it was possible, Moore’s Law and Metcalfe’s Law.

                Moore’s Law states that the speed and power of integrated circuits, from microprocessors to memory chips doubles every 18 months. Thanks to Moore’s Law it takes a fewer step to get to a higher power capacity since it doubles every two years the power and speed of the microprocessors and memory chips. This is the reason why computers have decreased in size in office environments and homes. Once this declaration was made, this was a rule to live by for microprocessors and memory chips to deliver smaller and faster products. Metcalfe’s Law, also known as the Moore’s Law of connectivity, is the other side of the coin that was able to burst the Dot Com Bubble. It states every new node, also known as a new computer, gets added to the network does not just increase the value of the network just by plus one, but a much steeper curve. For example, if we have two users, then that is one connection in between each user. If we have three users, then it gives us three possible connections. With four users it will go to four possible connections. If we go to 100 users, at this point we will have 5,000 possible connections. The number of possible users exponentially grow much faster the farther we go adding more users.
