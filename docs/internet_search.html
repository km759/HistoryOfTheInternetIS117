                Traversing the internet was no simple task in the early years of its public use. That was the case until the first internet search engine was created, Yahoo. Yahoo was in extremely early stages of being a true search engine like those that exist today. The founders of Yahoo would have to manually search the internet and categorize various websites they came across so that a user who visited Yahoo can follow through a category to find a website that matches their interest. It was not a perfect system and obviously had many flaws, but this was only the beginning of search engines on the internet. Even with how simple the site was, millions of users found their way to Yahoo and used it every day. At this point no company had ever really figured out how to make money on the internet, but the idea to advertise to users was introduced. Yahoo was reluctant to implement advertisements on their website in fear of alienating its user base. However, after placing banner ads on the site and bracing themselves for the worst outcome, Yahoo just became more and more popular, proving that a company can indeed make profit on the internet. A competitor to Yahoo was also founded called Excite. It was a similar search engine to Yahoo and it caused both companies to copy each other’s every move to make sure neither had the upper hand. Because of this feud between the sites, it seemed that the companies forgot their purpose in the first place, which was being a search engine first and foremost.

                    </div>

                Thus, Google was created to become the best search engine on the internet. Google worked by counting the links people would visit and decide on which links were more valuable to users. A link that was followed millions of times must be more useful than a link followed only ten or so times. Google would rank the websites using this method when searching on their site causing them to be a massive success. Google originated in the campus at Stanford, but was forced to move out after immense traffic would cause Stanford’s internet to almost crash completely. Due to the success of Google, the founders were able to garner millions of dollars from venture capitalists who believed in the website. Now Google needed to make money, but without turning into a site like Yahoo or Excite. Google realized they could become a market research tool and sell information to companies. Also, companies could pay Google to have their websites appear during a relevant search, which would ultimately benefit everybody involved. Google became the fastest growing company ever and is still the top search engine today.
