                Many important people have impacted our lives when it comes to using the internet in todayâ€™s date. Kevin Rose, Founder and Chief architect of Digg, was able to produce a website that aimed to select stories specifically for the internet audience such as science, trending political issues and viral internet issues. This gave the power to the people to vote and decide what was shown and important to see in the front page. Chad Hurley was the Co-Founder and former CEO of the video-sharing website known as Youtube. Thanks to this individual, sharing videos and giving the power to the people to post whatever they wanted to make it popular among peers was easy to use. This changed the online video entertainment industry since anyone could pickup a camera and just film themselves to do whatever they wanted to and post it on their website. Mark Zuckerberb, Founder and CEO of Facebook, managed to bring people together in an online social gathering to share your pictures, status and other interests with anyone without having to know them in person or be near them by any means. This gave the people the chance to interact with family members as well as friends and strangers.

                    </div>
            <p>
                The music industry also got a piece of the internet and many pioneers decided to hop in and revolutionize the way we listen to music. David Weekly was the pioneer of MP3, thanks to his hard work and dedication we were able to add music to the web with not much effort. Justin Frankel is the Co-Creator of Winamp, an application made specifically to listen to your music while using your pc. Shawn Fanning is the founder of Napster, the infamous website made to share music for free if a person has the original song on their computer. Since the web was still in its early stages, people were not thinking of the implications of copyrights and lawsuits. When Napster came onboard, many artists noticed how it was affecting their career since people were able to listen to their songs for free without having to pay any money. Napster got shut down immediately since the website itself was illegally distributing songs. Youtube almost went through the same route if it was not for google backing them up and helping them to push the lawsuit away. They would shut down copywriter videos and anything that could put their company in danger.
