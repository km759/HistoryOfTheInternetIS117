                The internet was not always the powerful information sharing tool that it is today. It was not until 1969 that the very first stage of the internet would be created, and the internet at that time was merely a fraction of what it has become today. Originally, the internet was actually called the ARPANET and was intended to be used by the government, not the public. The government required a better method of transmitting information than the current available technology. With a 1-million-dollar investment, the ARPANET was able to become a reality and the first form of internet was born by connecting only four computers together. The internet would slowly grow to accommodate more computers to be connected within the United States until the world wide web would be invented to connect the entire world together at once. The invention of the world wide web allowed information to be shared from any country all around the globe, which had never been possible before.

                    </div>

                It was not until 1992 however, that the internet would finally reach the hands of the public. Congress passed a bill that would take the internet out of the governments control and hand it over to be used by the public. Yet another invention that would spark massive interest in even using the internet would be e-mail. This application would allow users to share information, or letters, through the internet to another user. It was the same as sending a letter in the real world, but without every having to leave oneâ€™s home and it was much faster. Unfortunately, the internet at this time was not very user friendly, meaning that although a plethora of information was available to the average person, it would take an expert to actually be able to traverse the world wide web to find this information. This would all change quickly when the Mosaic browser was created, just one year later, in 1993. The browser would act much like browsers do today and forged a much more user-friendly environment for the average person to surf the web in. This popular creation combined with the increasingly popular e-mail application would increase the use of the internet by 341,000%! Due to this massive influx of new users, e-mail would quickly grow to eclipse the post office in sending letters. The internet would also create great economic growth, generating billions of dollars in business conducted over the internet.
