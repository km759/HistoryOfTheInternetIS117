            <h1>Browser Wars</h1>
            <p>
                Between 1994 and 1997 was an era of the internet that caused a huge uproar in the internet world. This period of time would come to be known as the Browser Wars, in which two companies would face off against each other to dominate the world wide web, and only one of them could be the one standing on top of it all. This all started with Bill Gates and his colleague, Paul Allen, who together would create Microsoft. Gates’ dream was to have every single household in the world have a computer that was running Microsoft software. By 1993, Gates’ dream was almost achieved as about 90% of the world’s computers were running on Microsoft Windows which would make Microsoft billions of dollars. It was due to this massive success that the creators of the original browser, Mosaic, back in 1993 would be compelled to create the competing browser, Netscape Navigator. The creators of Netscape knew that they had to take down Microsoft as it was their competition in this market, but Microsoft was already the tech giant in the industry. Netscape would quickly become very popular and Microsoft had to take notice of their new competitor and attempt to overcome them.

                Microsoft would go on to claim that they would negotiate with Netscape and attempt to work together with them, however Netscape told a completely different story. Netscape claimed that Microsoft would threaten distributers to put them out of business if they carried Netscape products. Microsoft would also try to either buy out Netscape and if they refused, would copy their every move to eliminate them. In order to be able to compete with Microsoft, Netscape would take the company public. This would be a risky move for such a new company typically, but for Netscape the plan worked out as stock prices and trading rose quickly. Microsoft had to do something to gain the upper hand and they decided to create their own browser, Internet Explorer. The benefit that Microsoft had was that the top talent worked there, and they had greater financial backing. Microsoft did in fact copy every move that Netscape would make with their browser and quickly copy it, releasing new versions of Internet Explorer rapidly. Then Microsoft would put the final nail in the coffin by making their browser completely free and seamlessly installed with every Windows computer. Netscape did not have the option to become a free browser and in turn would lose the browser war in September 1997, where Internet Explorer would be used by 80% of browser users. Microsoft would go on to be sued and found guilty of trying to maintain a monopoly over the industry which almost cause the company to break apart, but an appeal was made, and Microsoft was able to stay afloat. Gates would step down as CEO and Microsoft would continue to be a goliath in the industry.
